# Simple Workforce Agile Management Planning

## Press Release

Friday 7th April 2023, Sydney, Australia -- jdotw is thrilled to announce the limited beta availability of his Simple Workforce Agile Management Planning tool: SWAMP. Swamp is an _overlay_ that works on top of your existing HR systems to allow you to document, model and manage modern agile workforces without the friction and confusion that traditional HR systems create. SWAMP takes the list of people and their reporting lines from your existing HR system and allows you to model a workforce where capabilities and delivery are managed in multi-dimensional matrix structure. For example, you can define and map people to skillsets and capabilities and track the development of these groups and individuals over time. Similarly you can define and map people to delivery teams where they produce business outcomes and measure performance to goals.

Swamp is the people operation system for your modern agile organisation.
